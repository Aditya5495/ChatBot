Chatbot Overview
A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human-like conversations through text or voice interactions. Powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), chatbots can interact with users via messaging apps, websites, mobile platforms, or even phone calls.

Chatbots represent a significant leap in how humans interact with machines, serving as one of the most advanced and user-friendly interfaces. At their core, they are an evolution of traditional Question-Answering (QA) systems, enhanced by NLP capabilities to understand and respond in natural, conversational language.

Why Chatbots Matter
Enable seamless interaction between humans and machines

Improve user engagement and automate customer support

Widely adopted across enterprises for sales, service, and internal automation

Showcase practical applications of Machine Learning (ML) and NLP

Development Summary
We build chatbots using Machine Learning techniques, with a strong emphasis on NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) â€” a key Python library for NLP.

Chatbot Development Process
Import Essential Libraries
Utilize Python libraries like NLTK, NumPy, and others for text processing and logic.

Download and Configure NLTK Tools
Install tokenizers, stopword lists, lemmatizers, and corpora required for processing.

Preprocess Input Text

Convert text to lowercase or uppercase as needed

Remove unwanted characters, punctuation, and noise

Keyword Matching & Similarity Checks
Identify key terms and match them to predefined responses or intents using similarity metrics.

Generate Responses
Use retrieval-based or rule-based methods to return appropriate replies based on user input.
